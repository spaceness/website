          On September 9th, 2023, a new light flickered in the vast expanse of
          the software development world. Spaceness, a company founded on the
          belief in open-source collaboration, took its first steps. Unlike its
          commercially driven counterparts, Spaceness wasn't driven by profit
          margins or proprietary code. Instead, it was fueled by the passion of
          three individuals, codenamed "yosoof3," "incognitotgt," and
          "lolzthedev," who believed in the power of free and accessible
          software.
